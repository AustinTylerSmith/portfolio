      <p class="about-me flex justify-content-center">I am a full-stack developer with two years of experience, but my true passion lies in crafting intuitive
        and visually engaging front-end architectures. While my expertise spans the entire stack,
        there's something uniquely satisfying about bringing a user interface to lifeâ€”transforming complex ideas into
        seamless, user-friendly experiences. It's in those moments, where design meets functionality,
        that I find my day most rewarding.
